      I'm not going to write a one page long message so here's an excerpt from the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan's book "Écrits".
	  
	  "My research has led me to the realization that repetition automatism (Wiederholungs^wang) has its basis in what I have called the insistence of the signifying chain. 
	  I have isolated this notion as a correlate of the ex-sistence (that is, of the eccentric place) in which we must necessarily locate the subject of the unconscious, if we are to take Freud's discovery seriously.
	  As we know, it is in the experience inaugurated by psychoanalysis that we can grasp by what oblique imaginary means the symbolic takes hold in even the deepest recesses of the human organism.
	  The teaching of this seminar is designed to maintain that imaginary effects, far from representing the core of analytic experience, give us nothing of any consistency unless they are related to the 
	  symbolic chain that binds and orients them. I am, of course, aware of the importance of imaginary impregnations (Pragung) in the partializations of the symbolic alternative that give the signifying 
	  chain its appearance. Nevertheless, I posit that it is the law specific to this chain which governs the psychoanalytic effects that are determinant for the subject—effects such as
	  foreclosure {Verwerfung), repression {Verdrangung), and negation {Verneinung) itself—and I add with the appropriate emphasis that these effects follow the displacement (Entstellung) of the signifier
	  so faithfully that imaginary factors, despite their inertia, figure only as shadows and reflections therein. But this emphasis would be lavished in vain if it merely served, in your 
	  Seminar on "The Purloined Letter" 7 view, to abstract a general form from phenomena whose particularity in analytic experience would remain the core thing to you and whose original 
	  composite nature could be broken down only through artifice. This is why I have decided to illustrate for you today a truth which may be 12 drawn from the moment in Freud's thought 
	  we have been studying—namely, that it is the symbolic order which is constitutive for the subject—by demonstrating in a story the major determination the subject receives from 
	  the itinerary of a signifier. It is this truth, let us note, that makes the very existence of fiction possible. Thus a fable is as appropriate as any other story for shedding light
	  on it—provided we are willing to put the fable's coherence to the test. With this proviso, a fable even has the advantage of manifesting symbolic necessity all more purely in that
	  we might be inclined to believe it is governed by the arbitrary. This is why, without looking any further, I have taken my example from the very story in which we find the
	  dialectic of the game of "even or odd," from which we very recently gleaned something of importance. It is probably no accident that this story proved propitious for the continuation
	  of a line of research which had already relied upon it. As you know, I am referring to the tale Baudelaire translated into French as "La lettre volee." 
	  In it we must immediately distinguish between a drama and its narration as well as the conditions of that narration. We quickly perceive, moreover, what makes these components necessary
	  and realize that their composer could not have created them unintentionally. For the narration effectively doubles the drama with a commentary without which no mise-en-scene would be possible. 
	  Let us say that the action would remain, strictly speaking, invisible to the audience—aside from the fact that the dialogue would be expressly and by dramatic necessity devoid of whatever meaning 
	  it might have for a listener. In other words, nothing of the drama could appear, either in the framing of the images or the sampling of the sounds, without the oblique
	  light shed, so to speak, on each scene by the narration from the point of view that one of the actors had while playing his role in it. 
	  There are two such scenes, the first of which I shall immediately designate as the primal scene, and by no means inattentively, since the second may be considered its repetition in the sense
	  of the latter term that I have been articulating in this very seminar. The primal scene is thus performed, we are told, in the royal boudoir, such 13 that we suspect that the
	  "personage of most exalted station," also referred to as the "illustrious personage," who is alone there when she receives a letter, is the Queen. This sense is confirmed by the 
	  awkward situation she is put in "by the entrance of the other exalted personage," of whom we have already 
	  been told prior to this account that, were he to come to know of the letter in question, it would jeopardize for the lady nothing less than her "honor and peace." 
	  Any doubt that he is in fact the King is promptly dissipated in the course of the scene which begins with the entrance of Minister D—. For at that moment the Queen can do no 
	  better than to take advantage of the King's inattentiveness by leaving the letter on the table turned face down, "address uppermost." This does not, however, escape the 
	  Minister's lynx eye, nor does he fail to notice the Queen's distress and thus to fathom her secret. From then on everything proceeds like clockwork. After dealing with the business 
	  of the day with his customary speed and intelligence, the Minister draws from his pocket a letter similar in appearance to the one before his eyes and, after pretending to read it, 
	  places it next to the other. A bit more conversation to pull the wool over the royal eyes, whereupon he picks up the embarrassing letter without flinching and decamps, while the Queen, 
	  on whom none of his maneuver has been lost, remains unable to intervene for fear of attracting the attention of her royal spouse, who is standing at her elbow at that very moment. 
	  An ideal spectator might have noticed nothing of this operation in which no one batted an eye, and whose quotient is that the Minister has filched from the Queen her letter and, 
	  even more important, that the Queen knows that he now has it, and by no means innocently. A remainder that no analyst will neglect, trained as he is to remember everything having 
	  to do with the signifier even if he does not always know what to do with it: the letter, left on hand by the Minister, which the Queen is now free to crumple up."
